                Jonathon sees himself as a creator and host to the <strong>ideas</strong> and <strong>experiences</strong> that make us the most human. He creates content that is <strong>geographically</strong> specific, <strong>locally</strong> important, and <strong>complexly</strong> human. He believes his work should be <strong>thoughtful, intuitive</strong> and <strong>oscillate</strong> between several themes that seem at odds with each other.
